# Budget Predictor

Budget Predictor is a simple web app that lets you see how much money you will have
at the end of each month. You can insert your transactions (such as salary, rent, and other
expenses/income) and it will calculate how much money you will have each month.

# About

Budget Predictor was created with Vue.js. It does not actually save any data so each time
you visit the app you will have to enter your transactions again. The app is mostly just
for playing around with numbers and seeing how your finances could possibly look based
on your income and expenses. It is not meant to be an actual budgeting application that
makes decisions for you.
